# Penpal

Penpal (name temporary), is a fun social game where friends can write and share stories together. Using an invite-based system, the game allows only users who have been invited to contribute to stories, and only users who have contributed to read and share stories with their friends. With an edge of mystery and an immersive social experience, Penpal will keep you and your friends playing and laughing for hours on end!
